# Overveiw of the Four Horsemen App

</p>
This is our <b>Homepage</b>, it has a simple colour scheme which we kept throughout the site. I wanted to keep the design very minimal and so went for a black an white picture of trees, as I liked the theme of being lost in a digital age. I add the image carousel as I thought it was a good edition to capture peoples attention before their journey takes them further into the site. <b>The Navigation bar</b> is simple and kept to a minimum the only exception is our logo which evolved over time.

</p>
Clicking the <b>All the Developers</b> button in the nav bar takes you to the page the app is built around, it is a list of all of the featured developers which can be filtered to list in an A - Z or Z - A order, clicking on any of these developer icons will take you to the individual company page.</p>

<br><p>This is the <b>Company</b> page, listing important infomation a potential client would want to see. I added a mini portfolio on the left hand side to showcase each companies work.</p>

Scrolling down to the bottom of the <b>Company</b> page shows off the Googlemap for each company.

<p>The <b>Registration</b> page for new clients</p>
</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/login.51.29.png" width="700">
<p>The <b>Login</b> page</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/about.52.06.png" width="700"></p>
We decided to personalise the site and add an <b>About</b> page, I think that companies that do this make them selves more approachable by their customers, giving a face to the business.<br>


<h2>Things we would like to add to the App:</h2>
 <p> - Mobile App </p>
 <p> - Better email system (Mailchimp)</p>
 <p> - A professional Logo for the App</p>
<p>- bigger buttons for the carousel</p>
<p>- text message alerts for clients</p>
<p>- chat between client and customer</p>

# Final Thoughts

<p>While some things don't work as intended I really enjoyed this project. I had a concept before I started this app and did not have the time to complete it as I envisioned so I feel with the completion of this project it has given me the confidence to begin work on my original concept. </p>
<p> I think one of the things I enjoyed learning on this project is to trust in the team and your own abilities!</p>
